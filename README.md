Frontend - index.js renders the react application 
Backend - 
    controllers shud emails related logic stuff like fetchign emails from servers
    models - files related to db, defines the schema for tables etc
    routes - files related to apis used or to defines apis or to use apis for fetching the mails 
    config - contans config files for the app, database.js does the db connection
    app.js - main js file which sets up the express server and api routes 


create a project structure, list all the things u want to do, start with the easy part first, till whatever u have done make sure its completely functional then go to the next step, create branches at crucial steps if u ar not confident about the further steps.

things to do later on:
    GIT stuff (gitignore is necessary)
